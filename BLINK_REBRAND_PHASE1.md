# BLINK Rebrand — Phase 1 Spec (MishMesh → BLINK)

## Mission
Transform this entire MishMesh codebase into **BLINK** — same product structure, totally new identity. Phase 1 = visual + textual rebrand only. **DO NOT touch the orb/hunt logic yet (that's Phase 2).**

## What BLINK is
- Pokemon GO meets crypto. Players catch mystical creatures called "BLINK creatures" (Sprites, Cyclops, Cats, Oracles, etc.) scattered on a real-world map.
- Future: earn $BLINK tokens for catches. For v1: catches give points/collection.
- Telegram bot @TheEyeBlinkBot announces spawns/catches in real-time 24/7.
- Tagline: **"Don't blink. The Eye is open."**

## Brand identity (LOCKED — DO NOT DEVIATE)

### Colors — replace EVERYTHING
- Primary green: `#00FF88`
- Secondary bright green: `#88FF00`
- White: `#FFFFFF`
- Background black: `#0a0a0f`
- Surface black: `#0d0d14`
- Surface dark: `#1a1a24`

**KILL:**
- All cyan/turquoise (`#06b6d4`, anything teal)
- All purple/violet/indigo (`#6366f1`, `#8b5cf6`)
- Replace with green or white

### Logo
- **OFFICIAL BLINK logo:** `/Users/pasqualeceli/.openclaw/workspace/blink/logos/green/blink_OFFICIAL_logo_green.png`
- Copy it to `public/blink-logo.png` and use it everywhere you'd put a MishMesh logo
- It's a stylized anime eye inside a lightning bolt, in neon green + white on black

### Typography
- Keep existing fonts but if there's a `font-display` for headers, prefer something modern and slightly futuristic (Inter, Space Grotesk are fine)

### Glow effects
- Anywhere there's a blue/purple glow → replace with **green glow** (`#00FF88` at 40% opacity, box-shadow)
- Buttons/CTAs: green gradient background, white text

## Naming changes (rebrand language)

| Old (MishMesh) | New (BLINK) |
|---|---|
| MishMesh | BLINK |
| Mesh | The Eye (or "The Mesh of Eyes") |
| Orb | Creature |
| Orbs | Creatures |
| Hunt | Watch |
| Hunter | Watcher |
| Hunters | Watchers |
| Crack | Witness (the catching mechanic) |
| Crack page | Catch page |
| Leaderboard | The Council |
| Drop | Spawn |
| Map | The Eye Map |
| Mishmate | Eyemate (eyemate, or kill this if odd) |
| .mish files | leave alone (config) |

If you find any direct copy that says "MishMesh", "hunt", "orb", "hunter", "crack", "leaderboard" in user-facing UI text → replace.

## Tone of new copy
- **Cult-mystery for the landing page** (lore, "the Eye watches", "don't blink")
- **Game-fun inside the app** (catch creatures, level up, collect)
- Avoid corporate "We are a decentralized..." copy. Be direct, mystical, fun.

### Sample taglines to use
- "Don't blink. The Eye is open."
- "Catch what others can't see."
- "The Eye sees you. Now see back."
- "Sightings every minute. Worldwide."

## What to do — files to touch

### Required changes
1. **`tailwind.config.js`** — define BLINK palette (green/white/black) and replace any old MishMesh-specific colors
2. **`src/app/globals.css`** — CSS vars, body background, accent colors, glow utilities
3. **`src/app/layout.tsx`** — page title, description, OG meta
4. **`src/app/page.tsx`** (landing) — full rewrite with BLINK landing (eye logo, creatures floating, lore copy, CTA "ENTER THE EYE")
5. **`src/components/AppShell.tsx`** — top nav, sidebar, logo
6. **`src/components/BottomNav.tsx`** — tab labels (Watch / Catch / Council / Wallet / Eye)
7. **`src/components/HeroGlobe.tsx`** — repurpose as "HeroEye" (the central pulsing eye animation), creatures float around it
8. **`src/components/OrbAnimation.tsx`** → rename to **`CreatureAnimation.tsx`** (just animation; we don't change logic)
9. **`src/components/OrbMarker.tsx`** → rename to **`CreatureMarker.tsx`** (map pin)
10. **`src/components/OrbDetailSheet.tsx`** → rename to **`CreatureDetailSheet.tsx`**
11. **`package.json`** — name field: `blink`
12. **`README.md`** — rewrite the project intro
13. **`next.config.js`** — keep working; just verify
14. **`public/`** — drop the new BLINK logo files (logo, favicon, OG image)
15. All page metadata (titles, descriptions, OG tags) — update to BLINK branding

### Pages to rebrand (all under `src/app/`)
- `/` (landing — biggest rewrite)
- `/hunt` → `/watch` (rename folder)
- `/crack` → `/catch` (rename folder)
- `/leaderboard` → `/council` (rename folder)
- `/drop` → `/spawn` (rename folder)
- `/map` → keep at `/map` but rename internally
- `/missions`, `/messages`, `/wallet`, `/market`, `/live` — rebrand copy only
- `/legal-layout.tsx` — update branding
- `/auth/*` — update branding
- `/how-it-works` — full rewrite for BLINK (catching creatures, future $BLINK earnings)

### Don't touch (Phase 2 work)
- Orb spawning logic in `/src/lib/` — keep working as-is
- Crack/witness minigames — keep working as-is (we'll redesign in Phase 3)
- Supabase schema — keep as-is, just rebrand UI references
- API routes — keep functional
- Smart contracts — leave alone

## Landing page rewrite (`src/app/page.tsx`)

This is the centerpiece. Design:

```
[NAV BAR: BLINK logo + "Enter The Eye" CTA + connect wallet]

HERO SECTION (full viewport):
  Black background
  ANIMATED PULSING GREEN EYE in the center (use the green logo)
  4 creature PNG cutouts floating around the eye (Sprite, Cyclops, Cat, Oracle)
    - Slow drift/orbit animation
    - Each glows green/white
    - Each pulses gently
  Big headline: "Don't blink."
  Sub: "The Eye is open. Catch what others can't see."
  Primary CTA: "ENTER THE EYE" → /watch
  Secondary: "Join The Council" → telegram link https://t.me/blinkworldeth

LIVE TICKER STRIP (just below hero):
  Scrolling/auto-updating: "@watcher_x caught a Cyclops in NYC • Sprite spawning in Tokyo • 1,243 active watchers worldwide..."
  (For Phase 1 — static demo strings. Phase 4 will wire to real bot data.)

SECTION 2 — "The Bestiary"
  Heading: "20 species. Watching everywhere."
  Grid of creature cards (4 we have, placeholders for the other 16)
  Each card: image, name, rarity, "first sighted: TBD"

SECTION 3 — "How it works"
  3-step visual:
  1. WATCH — see the map. creatures spawn around you.
  2. APPROACH — walk to them (real or virtual). closer = better.
  3. WITNESS — catch them. earn rewards.

SECTION 4 — "The Council"
  Mini-leaderboard preview
  "Watchers who see more, earn more. $BLINK rewards coming."

SECTION 5 — TG bot section
  "The Eye Speaks 24/7"
  Screenshot/mockup of bot announcing catches
  CTA: "Join The Eye on Telegram"

FOOTER:
  Logo + links + small copy
```

Creature image paths (USE THESE — already exist):
- `/Users/pasqualeceli/.openclaw/workspace/blink/characters/green/blink_creature_sprite_green.jpg`
- `/Users/pasqualeceli/.openclaw/workspace/blink/characters/green/blink_creature_cyclops_green.jpg`
- `/Users/pasqualeceli/.openclaw/workspace/blink/characters/green/blink_creature_cat_green.jpg`
- `/Users/pasqualeceli/.openclaw/workspace/blink/characters/green/blink_creature_serpent_green.jpg`

Copy them into `public/creatures/` so the Next.js app can use them.

## Telegram & community
- TG group link: `https://t.me/blinkworldeth`
- Bot username: `@TheEyeBlinkBot`
- Any TG references in the codebase → update to these

## Deployment
- Project: existing Vercel project (orgId `team_LgB4TfxqVFZtCnrS5anreFCM`, projectId `prj_cue2gGetZ9aWx9kLg1J3vumBv0Xz`)
- Domain stays at **mishmesh.ai** for now (we'll switch domains later)
- After all changes: `vercel --prod` from this dir to deploy
- BUT DO NOT DEPLOY without my explicit "deploy now" confirmation. Build locally first. Run `npm run build` and verify no errors.

## Constraints / safety
- DO NOT break existing functionality (Supabase, wallet flows, auth)
- DO NOT remove environment variables or change `.env*` files unless I tell you
- DO NOT change `contracts/` (smart contracts)
- DO NOT touch the supabase migrations folder
- DO use Inline styles ONLY (no Tailwind classes for new components, per project rules in MEMORY.md). Use Tailwind in existing components only.
- DO NOT use emojis in UI (Telegram messages exempt) — per MEMORY.md
- DO NOT use mock/demo data — use real data from Supabase where applicable. For Phase 1 marketing copy, lore strings are okay.
- KEEP the build green (`npm run build` must succeed)
- LOG every file you change in a file called `BLINK_REBRAND_CHANGELOG.md` at project root

## Deliverable
1. All files modified/renamed per the spec above
2. `BLINK_REBRAND_CHANGELOG.md` listing every change
3. `npm run build` passes
4. Print summary of what you did at the end

Start now. Take your time. Quality > speed.
